        <h1>Bibliography</h1>
        <p>
            In the Bibliography homework we were tasked with creating two unique variations of the original Bibliography tutorial. One is a script and sans serif combination, and the other is a serif and sans serif variation. </p>
        <p>
            For the former (script/sans serif) variation I chose to go for an elegant and airy aesthetic. Scripts are typically associated with elegance and sophistication and should only be used sparingly due to the fact that they do not read well. They should be used to establish hierarchy and never in body copy. Script fonts work well to establish hierarchy because of their unique and artful shape so choosing to use a Cursive only in my headers was ideal. Doing this helped tie the headers together visually and lead the readers eye in a downward direction. I maintained the same color for each header throughout to establish a sense of cohesion and further engage the viewers sense of connection as they read through the material. For the body text I chose a sans serif font. Futura is a bold font that has very defined ascenders and descenders, and also slightly loose letter spacing, making it a legible font. The "a" in the font is not very legible because the aperture between the body and the leg of the letter is not wide enough, nevertheless I feel this a more legible sans serif than most because of it's bold weight and crisp shape. Making the font color a dark grey allowed for the header to be more visible and the text to be a slightly more secondary. The grey is also softer and supports the overall "feel" of this Bibliography.  </p>

            For the second (serif/sans serif) variation I chose to use Futura for the header. A sans serif font is less readable in body copy than a serif font generally speaking, so choosing Georgia for the body was an intentional choice based on legibility. Serif fonts read better than sans serif fonts because they have more discernable terminals. They are helpful in reading "long passages of text because they help the eye travel across a line, especially if lines are long or have relatively open word spacing"(fonts.com). This of course is not true of all serif and sans serif juxtapositions, but in this case it is a fitting comparison. I used the serif font for my header because it is bold and graphically appealing, establishing itself well as a contrasting element against the traditional sans serif body copy. The bright orange background color draws and engages the reader with color and warmth. The white headers stand apart starkly against the darker value background. I left a solid white bounding box around the introduction to help set it apart from the rest of the body copy and establish another layer of hierarchy for the reader. </p>
